It&#x27;s also valuable for consistent search results across computers without yielding even more information (logging in etc). A few times I made a query and found something useful and surprising, and then I wasn&#x27;t able to replicate the query on another computer to show someone else. In any case I&#x27;d hate to miss a rare interesting page because Google thought that extra 10 pages about Linux might interest me more.","time":1497171013,"type":"comment"}
